Stack Implementations in C and C++
This repository showcases two approaches to implementing a stack, one using a linked list in C and the other using an array within a class in C++.

1. Stack Using Linked List (C)
Overview: Implements a stack where elements are stored in a dynamically allocated linked list. This allows the stack to grow as needed, without a predefined limit.
Operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top.
Pop: Removes the top element.
Display: Shows all elements in the stack.
Count: Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.
Advantages: Flexible size, efficient memory usage for varying stack sizes.

3. Stack Using Class and Array (C++)
Overview: Utilizes a fixed-size array within a class to implement stack operations, suitable when the maximum stack size is known in advance.
Operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top.
Pop: Removes the top element.
Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
Empty Check: Verifies if the stack is empty.
Advantages: Simple and efficient for fixed-size stacks, with direct access to elements via array indexing.
Learning Outcomes:
Dynamic vs. Static Memory: Understand the differences in memory management between linked lists (dynamic) and arrays (static).
Practical Stack Operations: Develop hands-on experience in implementing and managing stack data structures in both C and C++.
